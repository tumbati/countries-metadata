## Data Sources

The country data, including continent and capital information, was sourced from [this Gist by tiagodealmeida](https://gist.github.com/tiagodealmeida/0b97ccf117252d742dddf098bc6cc58a). The original data was enriched by integrating additional details like dial codes and currency codes.

The flag emojis used in the metadata were sourced from the [country-flag-emoji-json](https://github.com/risan/country-flag-emoji-json) repository by [Risan](https://github.com/risan).

## How the Data was Generated

The `countries_metadata.json` file was generated by processing data from the [country-flag-emoji-json](https://github.com/risan/country-flag-emoji-json) repository and augmenting it with information sourced from [tiagodealmeida's Gist](https://gist.github.com/tiagodealmeida/0b97ccf117252d742dddf098bc6cc58a). This resulted in a comprehensive dataset containing various details for each country.
